                <p>We are raised to believe that white supremacy is limited to a marginal number of racist extremists, to those who see whites as biologically and culturally superior: the KKK, white nationalists, the alt-right, etc. That is a falsehood, a convenient one that removes the responsibility for racism to others, to bad people we don’t have anything to do with. White supremacy is all around us. We all participate in white supremacy, whether we like it or not.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In case the words from the very people who are affected by white supremacy every day are not enough to convince us (and they should be enough), there is plenty of evidence that white supremacy is systemic, that it's everywhere, and that it keeps people of color, particularly black people, down in all aspects of life.</p>

When controlling for the influence of other factors, including charge seriousness and prior record, compared to white defendants, blacks were 10% more likely (odds ratio = 1.48), Latinos 3% more likely (odds ratio = 1.14), and Asians 21% less likely (odds ratio = 0.41) to be detained. Racial disparities in pretrial detention were particularly large for misdemeanor person offenses where blacks were 20% more likely than whites to be detained.</p>

                            <p>Four studies demonstrated a bias against Black women with natural hairstyles in job recruitment. In Study 1, participants evaluated profiles of Black and White female job applicants across a variety of hairstyles. We found that Black women with natural hairstyles were perceived to be less professional, less competent, and less likely to be recommended for a job interview than Black women with straightened hairstyles and White women with either curly or straight hairstyles. We replicated these findings in a controlled experiment in Study 2. In Study 3A and 3B, we found Black women with natural hairstyles received more negative evaluations when they applied for a job in an industry with strong dress norms.</p>

                            <p>An NPR investigation found that white communities nationwide have disproportionately received more federal buyouts after a disaster than communities of color. Federal disaster aid is allocated based on a cost-benefit calculation meant to minimize taxpayer risk. That means money is not necessarily doled out to those who need it most but rather to those whose property is worth more — and to those who own property in the first place. That mirrors the existing <a target= _blank href="https://socialequity.duke.edu/sites/socialequity.duke.edu/files/site-images/FINAL%20COMPLETE%20REPORT_.pdf">racial wealth gap</a> in the United States.</p>

                                NPR analyzed records from a Federal Emergency Management Agency database of more than 40,000 property acquisitions, or "buyouts," funded by the agency from 1989 through 2017. The program buys homes from eligible homeowners who opt in. It then turns those lots into open space.

                                Our analysis shows that most of the buyouts in the FEMA database happened in neighborhoods that were more than 85 percent white and non-Hispanic, even though disasters affect all kinds of communities. For context, the U.S. is 62 percent white and non-Hispanic.
